                FFTSS Library Version 3.0 (2007/10/31)


[Introduction]

This software is a part of the result of the project 'Scalable
Software Infrastructure(SSI)' supported by "Development of Software 
Infrastructure for Large Scale Scientific Simulation", 
 Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology(CREST) at Japan
Science and Technology Agency(JST).

FFTSS is an open source library for computing the Fast Fourier
Transform.  Since FFTW is already de facto standard FFT library, we
made the interfaces of this library almost compatible with those of
FFTW.  This makes it easy to run your applications coded for FFTW.

FFTSS library includes many various FFT kernel routines.  In each
computing envirionment, the best set of the kernels is selected by
trial runs of them.  This is because it is difficult to detemine which
source program generates the fastest code.


[Limitations]

Although the interfaces of this library are compatible with those of
FFTW3, not all functions are implemented. Currently, input data must
be an array of double precision complex numbers, which length is
powers of two.  


[Header files]

fftss.h

    You have to include this header file to use FFTSS library calls.

pfftss.h

    You have to include this header file to use functions for MPI.

fftw3compat.h

    If you have an application program written for FFTW3, 
    you can simply change the name of header file to use FFTSS library.
